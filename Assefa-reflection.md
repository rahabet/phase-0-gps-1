What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  It was not difficult to get the commands while i was working alone. It took me sometime but I was able to understand it.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  -I understood why I need to do git pull first before beginning to do anything.

  -How the markdown works.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

 I asked my pair a lot of questions and he was able to answer all of them. just to mention one, I asked how to make the inline link. we asked the guide to tell us what the sort code block means

What still confuses you about git?

 I think i need to practice more on working with other people because i am still confused how the collaboration works

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

 It was confusing at first because I didn't know what to do in the beginning but we managed to talk it through and we get the to do the challenge. It takes longer time than expected but we both were ok to go on and finish it.
