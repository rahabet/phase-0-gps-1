1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

   Up to this point, we have been doing the pull/merge requests ourselves but in a standard workflow this would not be the case. I was a little unsure about how the proper workflow was and what each individual contributor would see on the repository that was being worked on.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

   The markdown concepts were clarified during this GPS and as well as the importance of making sure that we were doing the git pull/git status constantly.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

   We ran into a few questions regarding markdown formatting the code block and inserting the in-line picture and our guide assisted us with those concepts.

4. What still confuses you about git?

   I am currently still confused about collaboration and the pull/merge requests. However, I will continue to work on this to make sure that I understand it since it is going to be a vital part of our workflows moving forward.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

   It was a little nerve racking at first because I did not know what to expect. But I was glad to discover that both my pair and Bison were very friendly and made the experience pleasant.We did run into a couple issues regarding the challenge. I feel like my pair and I worked well to make sure that we understood what was going wrong and how to fix it.
